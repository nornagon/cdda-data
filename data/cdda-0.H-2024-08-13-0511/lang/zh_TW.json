Pierce damage usually penetrates armor better than cut damage, but does less damage overall, especially if you do not have a lot of skill in piercing weapons.  It, too, may be reduced by a monster's natural armor.  The typical damage per second values are for your survivor and account for moves per attack, encumbrance, missed strikes, weapon skill, critical hits, and target armor.  The 'Best' value is against an unarmored target with no Dodging skill.  The 'Vs. Agile' value is against an unarmored target with a high Dodging skill.  The 'Vs. Armored' value is against a target with more than 15 Bash and 20 Cut resistance but no Dodging skill.  These are typical values to let you assess the effectiveness of weapons; the amount of damage you actually inflict will vary depending on the situation.":"幾乎所有物品都能作為近戰武器使用，雖然有些比其他物品適合。 你能夠確認一件你身上物品的近戰屬性，按下<press_inventory>來打開你的物品欄，然後按下那個物品的字母代碼。 總共有五種近戰的數值：命中加成（或懲罰）、攻擊所需行動點數、還有鈍擊、砍劈、穿刺傷害。 命中加成增加了擊中怪物和變成暴擊的機率。 攻擊所需行動點數顯示了這武器需要多少行動點數進行攻擊，每 100 個行動點數代表了一秒鐘。 鈍擊能夠擊暈怪物，防止他反擊，但是這受到你的力量所影響。 砍劈傷害通常比鈍擊傷害好，但是許多怪物身上有能抵抗它的護甲。 穿刺傷害通常比砍劈上害更能貫穿護甲，但是整體來說製造更少傷害，特別是你沒有使用穿刺武器的技能時。 它也可能被怪物的護甲所減少。 通常每秒傷害是你的生存者通過計算攻擊所需行動點數、累贅、攻擊失手、武器技能、暴擊、和目標護甲。 「最佳」數值是當面對沒護甲而且沒閃避技能的目標時。 「對靈敏目標」數值是當面對沒護甲但是高閃避技能的目標時。 「對裝甲目標」數值是當面對護甲的鈍擊大於 15 和砍劈抗性大於 20 但是沒閃避技能的目標。 這些是參考的數值讓你能夠知道一件武器多有效；你實際造成的傷害會受到當時狀況所影響。","To wield an item as a weapon, press <press_wield>, then the appropriate letter.

If the height of the watertight hull is less than the vehicle's draft, then water will flow into your vehicle, and it will sink and be destroyed if it goes into deep water.  If your vehicle's draft is less than the height of the watertight hull, your vehicle will not take on water and will not sink in deep water.":"每個你加上的船體都會增加載具水密艙殼的高度。 如果水密艙殼的高度小於載具的吃水，那麼水就會流進你的載具，而且它會沉下去並且如果沉到深水時就會毀壞。 如果載具的吃水小於水密艙殼的高度，你的載具就不會進水也不會沉進深水。","Draft is determined by the length and width of your vehicle, the mass of your vehicle, and the percentage of the vehicle's underbody covered in boat hulls.  In general, a vehicle should be able to float if its mass in tons is less than a quarter of the product of its length and width, provided that the watertight hull is high enough.  A boat that is 5 tiles wide and 9 tiles long has a good chance of floating if its entire underbody is covered in boat boards and it weighs less than 10 tons.":"吃水是由載具的長寬、質量、底部被船體包覆的比例所決定的。 一般來說，載具如果質量的噸數比長乘寬的四分之一小應該能浮起來，此外還要有足夠高的水密艙殼。 一艘5格寬9格長的船有很好的機會能浮起來，假如整個底部有被船體包覆並且重量小於十噸的話。","Increased draft increases water drag, and water drag reduces a vehicle's speed in water.  If you want your boat to go fast, make it as light as possible.":"吃水增加也會增加水體主力，而且水體阻力會減慢載具在水裡的速度。 如果你想要船跑得快，讓它越輕越好。","Amphibious vehicles have both wheels and boat hulls.  As long as your amphibious vehicle has enough wheels on land and enough boat hulls to not sink in deep water, you can freely transition from land to water.  However, most amphibious vehicles are much slower in water than they are on land, so be careful when entering water to not leave your speed above your vehicle's safe water speed or you can burn out your engine!":"水陸兩用載具有輪胎和船體。 只要你的水陸兩用載具有足夠的輪子在路上跑和足夠的船體在水上漂，你就能自由地從陸地移動到水上。 然而大多的水陸兩用載具在水上會比在路上慢很多，所以當進入水域時注意別讓你的速度大於載具的水上安全速度不然你可能會燒壞你的引擎！","<s|S>: Skills and proficiencies":"<s|S>：技能與熟練專精","SKILLS":"技能","Each character has a collection of skills they may learn over time.

They are much more difficult to aim and control than larger firearms, and this is reflected in their poor accuracy.  However, their small size makes them appropriate for short-range combat.  They are also relatively quick to reload and use a very wide variety of ammunition.  Their small size and low weight make it possible to carry several loaded handguns, switching from one to the next as their ammo is spent.":"<color_light_gray>( 手槍</color>\n手槍是一種可單雙手持的小型武器。 它比較大的槍械更難瞄準及控制，反映在它孱弱的命中率上。 然而，因為手槍的的小尺寸讓他很適合使用在近距離戰鬥上。 手槍同時也能進行快速的裝填，並且能使用許多種類的彈藥。 小型的尺寸以及輕量，讓玩家能夠攜帶多把上膛的手槍，在一個種類的手槍子彈用完時就能夠換成用另外一種彈藥的手槍。","<color_green>( Crossbows</color>\nThe best feature of crossbows is low noise they produce.  The bolts they fire are only rarely destroyed; if you pick up the bolts after firing them, your ammunition supply will last much longer.  Crossbows suffer from a short range and a very long reload time (modified by your strength); plus, most only hold a single round.\nFor this reason, it is advisable to carry a few loaded crossbows.  Crossbows can be very difficult to find; however, it is possible to craft one given a high enough Fabrication skill.  Likewise, it is possible to make wooden bolts from any number of wooden objects, though these are much less effective than steel bolts.  Crossbows use the Rifles skill.":"<color_green>( 十字弓</color>\n十字弓最佳的優點就是無聲，射出的箭矢也大部分可以回收。 若是你撿取了射出的箭矢，就能夠保持彈藥量。 十字弓缺點就是射擊距離短以及超長的裝填時間 (由你的力量高低決定)；另外，大部分的十字弓一次只能裝填一發彈藥。\n因此，一次攜帶數把已上膛的十字弓是較佳的策略。 十字弓也相當難找到；然而，有足夠高的製造技能就有可能自行製作出來。 同樣的，也能夠用木製物品來製作箭矢，儘管傷害值不像鋼製箭矢大。 操作十字弓用到步槍技能。","<color_yellow>( Bows</color>\nSilent, deadly, relatively easy to make, and the arrows are reusable.  Bows have been used forever.  Bows are two-handed, and require the user to have a certain strength level.  If you do not have enough strength to draw the string back, you won't be able to use the bow.\nMost normal bows require strength of at least 8, others require an above average strength of 10, or a significant strength of 12.  Bows use the archery skill.":"<color_yellow>( 弓</color>\n安靜、致命、相對容易使用以及使用可重覆回收的箭矢。 弓長期以來扮演著重要的角色。 弓需要使用雙手操作而且它對使用者的力量有一定的要求。 如果你沒有足夠的力量將弓拉開，將無法使用弓。\n大多數的弓要求至少 8 點的力量，其他則要求 10 點力量，或是 12 點力量。此武器使用弓術技能。","<color_red>( Shotguns</color>\nShotguns are some of the most powerful weapons in the game, capable of taking out almost any enemy with a single hit.  Birdshot and 00 shot spread out after leaving the barrel, making it very easy to hit nearby monsters.  However, they are very ineffective against armor, and some armored monsters might shrug off 00 shot completely.  Shotgun slugs are the answer to this problem; they also offer much better range than shot.\nThe biggest drawback to shotguns is their noisiness.  They are very loud, and impossible to silence.  A shot that kills one zombie might attract three more!  Beware of that.":"<color_red>( 霰彈槍</color>\n霰彈槍是遊戲中最強大的一種武器，擁有對幾乎所有敵人一擊必殺的能力。 獵鳥霰彈及獵鹿霰彈在離開槍管後會散開來所以可以簡單地命中附近的怪物。 然而，這武器對付裝甲是相當沒有效率的，甚至有些裝甲的怪物對於獵鹿散彈的攻擊是免疫的。 而霰彈槍獨頭彈能夠解決這個問題；同時也能加長射程。\n霰彈槍最大的缺點就是造成的聲音過大。 聲音非常大，而且不可能消音。 只要對著殭屍射擊了一發，就會吸引附近全部的殭屍！謹記在心。","<color_cyan>( Submachine Guns</color>\nSubmachine guns are small weapons (some are barely larger than a handgun), designed for relatively close combat and the ability to spray large numbers of bullets.  However, they are more effective when firing single shots, so use discretion.  They mainly use 9mm and .45 ammunition; however, other SMGs exist.  They reload moderately quickly, and are suitable for close or medium-long range combat.":"<color_cyan>( 衝鋒槍</color>\n衝鋒槍是一種小型的武器（有些甚至比手槍還小），設計來在相對近距離戰鬥時快速射擊出大量的子彈。 然而，在單發射擊時也很有效，所以要斟酌使用。 通常使用 9mm 或 .45 口徑的彈藥，另外也有其他口徑的衝鋒槍。 衝鋒槍能夠快速的重新裝填，並且適合用在近距離或中長程的戰鬥上。","<color_brown>( Sniper and Marksman Rifles</color>\nSniper and marksman rifles are popular for their superior range and accuracy.  What's more, their scopes or sights make shots fired at targets at very long range as accurate as those fired at shorter range.

They also may be slow to reload and fire, so when facing a large group of nearby enemies, they are not the best pick.":"<color_brown>( 狙擊槍和來福獵槍</color>\n狙擊槍和來福獵槍的優勢在其超群的射程以及命中率。更重要的是，透過其瞄準鏡或是覘孔能夠順利地擊中非常遠的目標。不像突擊步槍，狙擊槍和來福獵槍通常沒有全自動連發射擊。同時其裝填與射擊速度可能很慢，所以當面對一大隊敵人的時候，你還是換個武器吧。","<color_blue>( Assault Rifles</color>\nAssault rifles are similar to hunting rifles in many ways; they are also suited for long range combat, with similar bonuses and penalties.  Unlike hunting rifles, assault rifles are capable of automatic fire.  Assault rifles are less accurate than hunting rifles, and this is worsened under automatic fire, so save it for when you're highly skilled.\nAssault rifles are an excellent choice for medium or long range combat, or even close-range bursts against a large number of enemies.  They are difficult to use, and are best used by skilled riflemen.":"<color_blue>( 突擊步槍</color>\n突擊步槍與來福獵槍有許多相似點，他們同樣都很適合進行遠距離戰鬥，有著相似的加成與懲罰。但不像來福獵槍，突擊步槍能夠使用全自動連發射擊。 突擊步槍的命中率比來福獵槍稍微低了點，而使用連發射擊時命中率更低，所以當你的技能較高的時候再來使用會比較好。\n突擊步槍是中長程戰鬥的好選擇，而近距離時也能利用連發的大量子彈來對付大量的敵人。 雖然使用門檻較高，但是在熟手上是個好用的武器。","<color_light_red>( Machine Guns</color>\nMachine guns are one of the most powerful firearms available.  They are even larger than assault rifles; however, they are capable of holding 100 or more rounds of highly-damaging ammunition.  They are not built for accuracy, and firing single rounds is not very effective.  However, they also possess a very high rate of fire and somewhat low recoil, making them very good at clearing out large numbers of enemies.":"<color_light_red>( 機槍</color>\n機槍是遊戲中最強力的一種槍械。他們的體積比突擊步槍大很多；但是他們能夠裝填高達 100 發以上的高傷害子彈。 這種武器不是以高命中率來設計的，所以單發射擊沒什麼效率。 然而，他們卻能以極高的射擊速度與低後座力，來達成掃除大量敵人的任務。","<color_magenta>( Energy Weapons</color>\n\"Energy weapons\" is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of rifles and handguns which fire lasers, plasma, or energy attacks.  They are mostly prototypes that started to appear in military use just prior to the start of the apocalypse, and as such are very difficult to find.\nEnergy weapons have no recoil at all; they are nearly silent, have a long range, and are fairly damaging.  The biggest drawback to energy weapons is scarcity of ammunition; it is wise to reserve the precious ammo for when you really need it.":"<color_magenta>( 能量武器</color>\n「能量武器」是對於各種步槍或手槍，只要是發射雷射、電漿或是發射其他能量彈武器的總稱。 他們的原形在災變發生時才剛研發出來，因此非常稀少。\n能量武器完全沒有後座力，幾乎是靜音的，並且能夠對於遠距離的目標造成大量傷害。 而能量武器的弱點就是彈藥相當稀少，因此要保留彈藥，除非到了非用不可的地步。","<4>: FAQ (contains spoilers!)":"<4>：常見問題（包含暴雷）","Q: What is safe mode, and why does it prevent me from moving?\nA: Safe mode is a way to guarantee that you won't die by holding a movement key down.

And if the camp has a well, I'll drink from the well when thirsty.

One of those zones must be a camp food zone.  If you drop food in the camp food zone and select the 'Distribute Food' mission, then the food will disappear and be converted into stored kcalories.\n  When you send companions out on camp missions, they'll eat from the stored food when they return at the rate of 2,500 kcalories per day.  Some missions have variable length, and companions will become upset if there isn't enough food when they come back, so try to keep a healthy surplus of food on hand.\n  Companions who aren't on camp missions, but who are following you, will also eat from the camp food stores whenever they're hungry and within 2 overmap tiles of the camp.  This drastically simplifies keeping your followers fed, so it's worthwhile to build a minimal faction camp just for this feature.\n  You can upgrade a camp to include a water well.  If you do, your followers will also drink from the well when they're thirsty.":"陣營營寨需要食物，不過可以更簡單的管理你的追隨者。\n當你啟動一個營寨布告欄時，如果你還沒設定區域管理（預設：Ｙ）你需要有一些自定義分類空間。其中一個是營寨儲糧區。你可以將食物放在這個區域，然後按下＂分配食物＂任務，然後食物會消失並轉換成營寨儲存的卡路里。\n當你指派追隨者去執行營寨任務時，他們回來時會根據消耗時間吃掉營寨存糧，比率為 2500 千卡／每天。有些任務相當的長，當你的追隨者完成任務歸來卻沒有吃到足夠的食物，會導致他們不滿，請努力維持足夠存糧以保證營寨健康。\n當追隨者並不處於任務中，但跟隨著你，當他餓的時候且在世界地圖離營寨兩格內，他會自己去吃掉營寨的食物。這簡化了你維持追隨者溫飽的工作，所以哪怕只是建立一個超小型營寨只為了供應食物也是很好的。\n你可以給你的營寨升級一個水井。如果你這樣做，追隨者們也同樣會自動在渴的時候去飲水。","Tell me about modular field camps.":"告訴我關於模組化野外營地的事。","Got it.

I was in trade college, learning to be a computer technician.  Those skills aren't too helpful, but when I was a kid I was an Eagle scout.

Have you noticed how they pay us in these tiny little gold coins?\"  Cranberry holds one up for emphasis.  \"It's bizarre.

The magazine looks like something for an assault rifle, but the magazine well itself is strangely designed and seems to be fitted with an adapter to make the magazine actually fit.\n\n\"Whatcha think?\"":"*拿起槍，轉了幾個角度向你展示。你從沒見過像這樣的東西；鋼製槍身和藍色聚合物槍托，看起來先進而輕巧。現代化混合瞄準鏡，內置配件，側面有個奇怪的快速釋放按鈕。彈匣看起來是給突擊步槍用的，但設計看起來很奇怪，似乎有個適應器，讓彈匣能配合使用。\n\n看起來如何？","Is that a custom Hub rifle?":"這是Hub開發的步槍？","Where'd you find that thing?":"你在哪裡找到這東西的？","Sweet piece of salvage.":"這戰利品可真棒。","It's from our employers.

I'm here though.":"那有很多肉要分解。你需要一個正規的屠宰設備、釣和其他東西，然後找方法冷藏，或者更進一步，冷凍它，還要找方法令它保存得更久。可以做肉乾，或者製作成罐頭。最重要的是要在肉開始腐爛之前做完。嘿，我認識一位很多的廚師可以幫到手。不，她已經死了。但這裡還有我。","I'm getting hungry.":"我開始覺得肚餓了。","dino

Creates a multi decade timeline of dimensional spillage prior to the cataclysm.  This spillage was characterized by thin places appearing where people could step through into another dimension but things from those dimensions could wander into our world as well.  Xedra proliferated into an alphabet soup of agencies dedicated to simultaneously stopping, controlling, and utilizing these thin places with varying degrees of success.  Contains monsters of various types, new professions and locations, new uses for existing skills plus the new deduction skill, new magic systems, and content of every type that a multidimensional Cataclysm has to offer.  This is a heavily science fantasy mod where you are as likely to encounter supernatural monsters, as you are to encounter UFOs and Sasquatch and Chupacabra.

Time to get the hell out of here.":"當世界終結時，你享受著奢華的生活，被財富環繞，每天都能吃得很好。現在，你在自己豪宅的一個陌生房間中醒來，獨自一人而且嗑了藥。當你努力保持清醒時，你聽到附近有沉重的腳步聲。是時候離開這鬼地方了。","scen_desc_female\u0004You have survived the initial wave of panic, and have achieved (relative) safety in one of the many government evac shelters.  However, the people you came with started to turn and now they're out for your flesh!  You've holed up in the basement for now, but sooner or later you have to make for the door… and fast!":"你在第一波的恐慌中倖存下來，並在眾多政府疏散避難所中獲得了(相對的)安全。然而，與你一同前來的人們開始變異，現在他們都想著吃掉你的肉！你暫時躲在地下室中，但遲早你必須朝著門口前進……而且要快！","scen_desc_female\u0004You were on a mission off the coast of North Korea when the aircraft carrier you were stationed on suddenly and inexplicably found itself in the middle of a lake.  You have no idea where you are or what's happened, but you have more important things to worry about: everyone else aboard seems to have become violently insane.  It might be time to abandon ship.":"你在北韓外海執行任務時，所在的航空母艦突然莫名其妙地發現處在一個湖中央。你不知道自己身處何處，發生了什麼事情，但你有更重要的事情要擔心：船上其他人似乎都變得極度瘋狂。或許是時候棄船逃生了。","scen_desc_female\u0004After a lifetime of hard work, you managed to settle down in a posh retirement community.  You saw the riots on the news but assumed they would have no reason to attack some harmless old folks.  That assumption was proven wrong by a group of lunatics breaking in, leaving you no choice but to deal with them personally.  Welcome to your golden years.":"在一生中辛勤工作之後，你成功安頓在一個豪華的退休社區。你在新聞上看到了騷亂，但認為他們不會攻擊一些無害的老傢伙。然而，一群瘋子破門而入證明你錯了，你別無選擇，只能親自應對他們。歡迎來到你的黃金歲月。","scen_desc_female\u0004When the Cataclysm happened, you were working in a nuclear power plant.

Now you are injured, surrounded and the building is on fire.  You hope you have some time before it returns to finish the job.":"你不知道那玩意是什麼，但你成功暫時擺脫了它。現在你受傷了，四面楚歌，建築物正在著火。你希望在它回來了結你之前還有一些時間。","scen_desc_female\u0004You were camping in the wild to let things back home cool off.

Days of boredom and a return to bad habits made you overdo it with the booze last night.  You awake and find yourself confused by the strange behaviour of people outside.  Time to sober up and see what's going on.":"你試圖離家保持距離，低調過日子。無聊的日子和重拾壞習慣使你昨晚喝得爛醉。你醒來時發現外面的人們舉止怪異，讓你感到困惑。是時候清醒過來，看看發生了什麼事情。","scen_desc_female\u0004When FEMA camps ran out of space the authorities used what was left of their manpower to round up people at gunpoint.  The stadiums they forced everyone into did nothing to slow down the madness and it spread like wildfire.  You managed to slip away from the worst violence but you are now surrounded and need to escape quickly!":"當聯邦緊急事務管理局的營地容納不下更多人時，當局利用他們剩餘的人力以槍口脅迫人群進入體育場，但這沒有減緩如野火般蔓延的混亂。你設法躲過了砲火，但現在你被包圍住了而且需要迅速逃出去！","scen_desc_female\u0004During your escape you got lost and ended up at the wrong location.

Wandering in your temple, you just found books that may restore your faith or shatter it completely.":"你已經為信仰傳道很長一段時間，但是最近發生的事讓你開始對此感到懷疑。在你的教會中徘徊時，你找到的書可能會恢復你的信念或完全粉碎它。","scen_desc_female\u0004You have been an apprentice to a wizard for some time now, working on a prototype device that could perhaps be used to escape from the Cataclysm.  Something went wrong with the maiden voyage though, and your teacher teleported his insides into his outsides.  Now you have to figure out how to survive on your own.  At least he left his notebook…":"你已經當魔法師的學徒一段時間了，他正在製作一個原型設備，或許能用來逃離大災變。然而，首次運行出了點問題，你的老師將他的五臟六腑傳送到他的軀殼之外。現在你必須找出方法如何靠自己生存。至少他留下了他的筆記本…","scen_desc_female\u0004You have been an apprentice to a wizard for some time now, you've saved for years for your dream vacation at a secluded wizard tower.  Your journey of self-discovery is interrupted by the Cataclysm.

You have been placed on a floating island high above the Earth, safe but isolated.  Only by using the reality-bending powers of warp technology can you visit the world below in brief, randomly-targeted excursions below.  Venture down, gather supplies, and return with only what you can carry to build up your home base and your stash over time.  The powers of the warp make you unable to ever truly die, so on failing such an expedition, you will simply lose all items and equipment you were carrying and be swiftly returned home at low health.":"彷彿世界末日還不夠，似乎某種超維度的力量開始對你產生興趣。你被放置在高高飄浮於地球上空的浮島上，安全但孤立。只有利用扭曲現實的傳送科技，你才能短暫地隨機降落到地面上。冒險前往地面，收集物資，然後攜帶所能攜帶的東西回到家園基地，並隨著時間逐漸累積你的庫存。傳送的力量使你永遠不會真正死亡，所以一旦在此類冒險中失敗，你只會失去所有攜帶的物品和裝備，然後迅速以瀕死狀態返回家。","scen_desc_female\u0004In the chaos and panic of evacuation, you got bitten by something!  You didn't get proper medical care, and now the wound has started turning green.":"在撤離行動的慌亂之中, 你被某個東西咬到了! 你沒有做好醫療處置, 傷口開始感染化膿。","scen_desc_female\u0004You have survived the initial wave of panic, and have achieved (relative) safety in a wilderness.
