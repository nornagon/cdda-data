Rather than exploring an underground dungeon, with a limited area on each level, you are exploring a truly infinite world, stretching in all four cardinal directions.  In this survival game, you will have to find food, keep yourself hydrated, and also sleep periodically.  It's based on the principle of realism, so expect all of the hardships you'd expect in a real-life survival situation, and at least a dozen more from the eldritch and sci-fi nature of the Cataclysm itself.":"Walaupun orang mungkin berpikir Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead adalah roguelike, game ini sangat berbeda dari roguelike traditional dengan beberapa perbedaan yang penting.

Pressing Shift+vikeys (h,j,k,l,y,u,b,n) will scroll the view persistently, allowing you to keep an eye on things as you move around.":"Karakter pemain bisa melihat lebih jauh daripada apa yang ditampilkan dalam layar. Menekan <press_look> akan memasukkan kamu ke mode \"Lihat Sekitar\", yang memungkinkan kamu untuk menggulir menggunakan tombol-tombol gerakan and tampilkan barang-barang sekitar, serta makhluk-makhluk lainnya dan sikapnya terhadap pemain. Menekan <press_listitems> akan memberikan kamu daftar barang sekitar, tetapi barang dalam peti, lemari, kulkas, dan lain lain tidak akan muncul di daftar tersebut sampai kamu cukup dekat.
